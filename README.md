# Recipe Organizer

## Specification
This team developed an application that can search and store recipes. The application allows the user to search for recipes based on an entered keyword. The user is able to select recipes from search results to add to a personal collection, which could function like a daily meal plan. The added recipe's information is automatically written into a saved text file. Given the meal plan, this application would then be able to generate a shopping list from the user collection based on the ingredients in each recipe.
